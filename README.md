# DancingLine-Demo
How to make a game like &lt;DancingLine> in Google Play.

The game <DancingLine> in Google Play is really a great game .Beautiful melody,nice picture ,simple operation and so on!

This project is the game demo,so there is a lot of places to complete.
Thanks for @RainbowHerry,his scene models decrease much work. I delete many unnecessary planes,overwrite the code(useing object pool,that can reduced performance cost)and so on.
